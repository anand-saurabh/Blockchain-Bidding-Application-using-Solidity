In this repository, we will be implementing a smart contract using Solidity language for a Blockchain bidding application
The seller starts the bidding process by notifying the potential buyers. The potentail buyers place their bid amounts and this process continues till the auction ends. 
At the end of the auction the buyer with highest bid gets the item being sold. The beneficiary (seller) get the money in his account. I have used solidity language coding and 
Ganache for deloying the blockchain application locally.
